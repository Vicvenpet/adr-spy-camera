# AndroidSpyCamera

This app shows how you can quietly take photos of app user via front camera. After opening it shows an image with puzzle (its role is to attract attention) while fromt camera takes photos every 2 secs and saves it into ~/Android/data/{appId}/files.

Basically advantage: app targets on API 22, so you WILL NOT SEE A RUNTIME PERMISSION TO ACCESS CAMERA.
